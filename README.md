# Hi :wave:, I'm Jacob
<img align="right" src="https://jhilker.com/pics/jhilker.jpg" style="border-radius: 50%;"/>

Hi, I'm Jacob, an avid gamer (both tabletop and video games) and programmer, with my favorite game in particular being Super Metroid from the SNES. I recently graduated from the University of Mary Washington with a major in computer science and a minor in cybersecurity. Outside of programming, I enjoy sound design, worldbuilding, and playing music as a whole (drums, bass, and guitar).

  <summary><strong>Some Fun Facts</strong></summary>
  
  - I am the middle of a set of triplets (2 sisters).
  - I started playing drums in 6th grade, then guitar in 11th, and finally bass my senior year of college.
  - I am also working on 2 worldbuilding projects currently, one of which is an alternate history setting.
  - One of my favorite bands is Coheed and Cambria.
