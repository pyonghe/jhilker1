# Hi :wave:, I'm Jacob
<img align="right" src="https://jhilker.com/pics/jhilker.jpg" style="border-radius: 50%;"/>
Hi, I'm Jacob, an avid gamer (both tabletop and video games) and programmer, with my favorite game in particular being Super Metroid from the SNES. I recently graduated from the University of Mary Washington with a major in computer science and a minor in cybersecurity. Outside of programming, I enjoy sound design, worldbuilding, and playing music as a whole (drums, bass, and guitar).
